# Variants

Hanabi Live is programmed by Hanabi enthusiasts who have played thousands of games. In order to keep the game fresh, the server allows you to create games using several custom variants. Beyond this, players also have the ability to further custom a game by using a number of [custom game options](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-live/blob/master/docs/FEATURES.md#custom-game-options).

<br />

### None / No Variant

* This is the "base" game, with 5 suits. Unlike some real-life versions of the game, Hanabi Live uses the following five suit colors:
  * Blue
  * Green
  * Yellow
  * Red
  * Purple

### Six Suits

* An orange suit is added.
* It works identical to the other suits in that you can clue orange cards with orange clues.

### Four Suits

* The purple suit is removed.

### Three Suits

* The red and purple suits are removed.

### White

* A white suit is added.
* No color clues "touch" the white suit. (It is a colorless suit.)

### Black

* A black suit is added.
* It works similar to the other suits in that you can clue black cards with black clues.
* There is only one of each black card in the deck, which means that every black card is "critical".

### Rainbow

* A rainbow suit is added.
* All color clues will "touch" the rainbow suit.

### Dark Rainbow

* A dark rainbow suit is the same as a rainbow suit, except that there is only one of each card in the deck. This means that every dark rainbow card is "critical".

### Color Blind

* Color clues touch no suits. (Empty color clues are always allowed.)

### Ambiguous

* Two suits share a color. There is no way to disambiguate between them with color clues.

### Very Ambiguous

* Three suits share a color. There is no way to disambiguate between them with color clues.

### Dual-Color

* Each suit is touched by two separate colors.

### Multi-Fives

* Fives are "touched" by all rank clues.
* Players cannot clue rank 5.

### Up or Down

* This variant was invented by [Sean McCarthy on the BoardGameGeek forums](https://boardgamegeek.com/article/30863162).
* Two 1's are removed from each suit.
* One "START" card is added to each suit.
* When a stack is empty, you can play either a 1, a 5, or a START card on it.
* When a stack has a START card on it, you can play either a 2 or a 4 on it.
* If a stack was started with a 1 (or a START + 2), then it works as a normal stack.
* If a stack was started with a 5 (or a START + 4), then it must be completed in reverse.
* A clue token is given when a stack is completed, regardless of whether it is a normal stack or a reversed stack.

### African American

* This is a mix of several variants. The suits are as follows:
  1. Tomato (red)
  2. Mahogany (red)
  3. White (colorless)
  4. Sky (blue)
  3. Navy (blue)
  6. Black (one of each)

### Wild & Crazy

* This is a mix of several variants. The suits are as follows:
  1. Green (blue / yellow)
  2. Purple (blue / red)
  3. Orange (yellow / red)
  4. White (colorless)
  5. Rainbow (all colors)
