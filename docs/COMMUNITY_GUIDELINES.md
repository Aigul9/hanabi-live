# Hanabi Live Community Guidelines

Since Hanabi Live is a website that provides a chat room for random strangers on the internet, there is the potential for abuse. We ask that citizens of the website follow a few rules so that our public discussion meets a certain minimum level of quality.

1) Use common sense.
2) Keep discussion safe for work. (No porn, gore, etc.)
3) Use English.
4) Keep excessive discussion out of the lobby in order to avoid spamming everyone else.
5) Keep off-topic discussion in the #off-topic channel. Excessive non-Hanabi related discussion should be taken to private messages or a separate Discord server.
6) Treat others with respect. Flames, personal attacks, and so forth should be handled in either a private message or off platform.
7) Do not post another user's personal information without their prior consent.
